ðŸ§ª Research Brief: Communication in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Near the SAT Phase Transition
Title
"When Talking Isn't Enough: Communication Breakdown in Multi-Agent Q-Learning on Phase Transition SAT Problems"

Overview
This project investigates the role of inter-agent communication in solving hard SAT problems, with a specific focus on those lying near the phase transition boundary â€” a regime empirically known to maximize problem hardness. Using communicating Q-learning agents, we evaluate how varying communication thresholds affect solvability, learning progression, and communication utility in critically-constrained environments.

Motivation
SAT problems around clause-to-variable ratios (Î± â‰ˆ 4.2) exhibit a sudden phase transition in solvability, a phenomenon that mirrors critical behavior in physics.s

Understanding how learning agents behave in this regime is essential to advancing hybrid symbolic-connectionist solvers.

We ask: Can agents learn to coordinate effectively in this edge-case? And if so, does communication help them cross the hardness threshold?

Research Questions
Can multi-agent Q-learning agents solve SAT instances near the phase transition regime?

How does communication thresholding affect success rates, convergence time, and communication benefit?

Does a high communication benefit translate into successful solutions near the hardness cliff?

Methodology
Problem Type: SAT instances generated near Î± â‰ˆ 4.2 (phase transition region).

Agents: Q-learning agents operating under:

Cooperative, Competitive, and Communicative reward paradigms.

Communication restricted by thresholded relevance scoring.

Metrics:

Episodes to solution

Average communication benefit

Communication threshold sweeps

Runtime statistics and significance testing (e.g., t-tests)

Key Findings
100% of communicative agents succeeded on non-phase-transition hard instances.

On phase-transition problems:

0% success rate, regardless of communication threshold (0.3, 0.5, 0.7).

Agents converged early to non-optimal strategies (episode ~101).

Communication benefit remained high (~16) across all thresholds.

Statistical tests revealed no significant runtime or reward improvement via increased communication.

Interpretation
High communication benefit does not imply effective information transfer or improved problem-solving in edge cases.

Agents appear to reach communication saturation where they exchange information but fail to extract or act on critical constraints.

This supports the hypothesis that SAT phase transition problems pose structural, not heuristic, limitations to current learning-based approaches.

Next Steps
Message Content Analysis: Quantify the entropy, redundancy, and informativeness of agent messages.

Specialization & Role Asymmetry: Assign agents distinct roles (e.g., clause expert, variable tracker) and study emergent behavior.

Hybrid Oracle Augmentation: Use traditional SAT solvers to critique agent behavior and highlight dead-ends in policy search.

Expand Thresholds + Curriculum Learning: Test dynamic communication thresholds that evolve with agent confidence or difficulty estimation.

Contributions
Presents the first empirical evidence (in this setup) that even beneficial communication fails to overcome the computational bottlenecks imposed by phase transition SAT problems.

Opens a window for interpretable agent design and neuro-symbolic hybrid solvers for critical complexity regions in CSPs.
